# nes-scribbles

Bits and pieces of small programs I made for the NES as I learn. Inspired by Pinobatch's [little things](https://github.com/pinobatch/little-things-nes).
 
 These scribbles are built using CA65, LD65, and make in a suitable bash environment. for more details, visit Pinobatch's [NROM template](https://github.com/pinobatch/nrom-template/) and follow the instructions for building.
 
 ## nes scribble list:
 
 * [Hello_NES](nrom-hello-world/)
	 - My official first NES program!
	 - A text will appear after 1 second has elapsed.
 * [BG-andalf the White-Gray](BG-andalf_the_White-Gray)
	 - This program is intended to help in observing and investigating jailbars in NES and Famicom video outputs.
	 - Press A to change the BG color.
	 - Yes the name was a pun on the BG being white or gray.
