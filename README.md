# nes-scribbles

Bits and pieces of small programs I made for the NES as I learn. Inspired by Pinobatch's [little things](https://github.com/pinobatch/little-things-nes).
 
 These scribbles are built using CA65, LD65, and make in a suitable bash environment. for more details, visit Pinobatch's [NROM template](https://github.com/pinobatch/nrom-template/) and follow the instructions for building.
 
 ## nes scribble list:
 
 * [Hello_NES](nrom-hello-world/)
	 - My official first NES program!
	 - A text will appear after 1 second has elapsed.
 * [BG-andalf the White-Gray](BG-andalf_the_White-Gray)
	 - This program is intended to help in observing and investigating jailbars in NES and Famicom video outputs.
	 - Press A to change the BG color.
	 - Yes the name was a pun on the BG being white or gray.
 * [NROM-Beeper](nrom-beeper)
	 - This simple program makes a beep when you press B
	 - Created to debug my NROM prototypes.
 * [NROM-Scroller](nrom-scroller)
	 - I wanted parallax stars, so I made parallax stars!
 * [NROM Composite Example](nrom-composite-decoded)
	 - This ROM was quickly made for replicating the [NTSC signal generation example image](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/File:NTSC_video_ragged_box.png) found in the NESDev wiki.
 * [NROM 2A03G APU DAC Test](nrom-dac-test)
	 - This ROM is for testing and probing the DAC outputs of the APU, utilizing the [CPU test mode](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/CPU_Test_Mode).
 * [NROM 2A03 Amp Test](nrom-amp-test)
	 - This ROM is for measuring the amplifier characteristics of the Famicom/NES.
 * [NROM Composite Waveform Example](nrom-composite-waveform)
	 - This ROM was quickly made for demonstrating the [NTSC PPU composite signal waveform example](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/NTSC_video#Example_Waveform) found in the NESDev wiki.
