# nes-scribbles
 Bits and pieces of small programs I made for the NES as I learn. Inspired by Pinobatch's [little things](https://github.com/pinobatch/little-things-nes).
 
 These scribbles are built using CA65, LD65, and make in a suitable bash environment. for more details, visit Pinobatch's [NROM template](https://github.com/pinobatch/nrom-template/) and follow the instructions for building.
