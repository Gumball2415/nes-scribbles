# NROM Scroller

## About

I wanted parallax stars, so I made parallax stars. Best viewed in composite for twinkling stars!

## Use

Use the DPad buttons to change the direction of scrolling.

## Compiling

Dependencies (these must be available in path):
- CA65
- LD65
- Mesen
Run the makefile in a suitable bash environment. For more detailed instructions, refer to Pinobatch's [NROM template](https://github.com/pinobatch/nrom-template). If no bash environment is available, run the make.bat file.
