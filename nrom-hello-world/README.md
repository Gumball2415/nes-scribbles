# NROM Hello World

## About
This is my first serious-ish attempt at making a functioning program for the NES with CA65 assembly. Some help was required, and I have much people to thank in the credits :P

## Use
This program loads a nametable with text and a thin white border onto the screen. After approximately 1 second, more text will appear onto the screen. 

## Compiling
Dependencies (these must be available in path):
- CA65
- LD65
- Mesen
Run the makefile in a suitable bash environment. For more detailed instructions, refer to Pinobatch's [NROM template](https://github.com/pinobatch/nrom-template).
