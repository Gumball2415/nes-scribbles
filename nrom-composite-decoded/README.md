# NROM Composite Example

## About

This ROM was quickly made for replicating the [NTSC signal generation example image](https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/File:NTSC_video_ragged_box.png) found in the NESDev wiki.

## Use

Press B to make the square red.
Press A to make the square white.
Press Start to make the screen white.
Measure the resulting composite waveform using an oscilloscope.

## Compiling

Dependencies (these must be available in path):
- CA65
- LD65
- Mesen

Run the makefile in a suitable bash environment. For more detailed instructions, refer to Pinobatch's [NROM template](https://github.com/pinobatch/nrom-template). If no bash environment is available, run the make.bat file.
